# RandSplash - Random Themed Photo Server

A simple Python server that serves random photos from Unsplash based on themes, with built-in caching to optimize API usage.

## Features

- üñºÔ∏è Fetch random high-quality photos from Unsplash based on themes
- üíæ Built-in caching mechanism to reduce API calls
- üîç Support for multiple keyword searches
- üöÄ Simple REST API with Flask
- üê≥ Docker support for easy deployment

## API Endpoints

### `GET /`
Returns usage instructions.

### `GET /random/<theme>`
Returns a random photo matching the specified theme.

**Examples:**
- `/random/nature` - Random nature photo
- `/random/ocean%20sunset` - Random photo with ocean AND sunset
- `/random/city+night` - Random photo with city AND night
- `/random/mountain%20lake%20sunrise` - Random photo with all three keywords

### `GET /health`
Returns server health status and cache duration configuration.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Unsplash API credentials (Access Key and Secret Key)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/randsplash.git
cd randsplash
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure environment variables:
   - The `.env` file should contain:
```env
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key_here
UNSPLASH_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
CACHE_DURATION_SECONDS=600
```

Note: `CACHE_DURATION_SECONDS` has a minimum value of 600 seconds (10 minutes) to respect API rate limits.

### Running the Server

#### Local Development
```bash
python server.py
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`

#### Using Docker

1. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t randsplash .
```

2. Run the container:
```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 randsplash
```

## Configuration

| Environment Variable | Description | Default | Minimum |
|---------------------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` | Your Unsplash API access key | Required | - |
| `UNSPLASH_SECRET_KEY` | Your Unsplash API secret key | Required | - |
| `CACHE_DURATION_SECONDS` | How long to cache photos (in seconds) | 600 | 600 |

## How It Works

1. When a request is made to `/random/<theme>`, the server checks its cache
2. If a cached photo exists for that theme and is less than `CACHE_DURATION_SECONDS` old, it's returned immediately
3. Otherwise, a new photo is fetched from Unsplash API
4. The new photo is cached and served to the client
5. Full resolution images are served for the best quality

## Example Usage

```bash
# Get a random nature photo
curl http://localhost:5000/random/nature > nature.jpg

# Get a random photo with multiple keywords
curl http://localhost:5000/random/tropical%20beach > beach.jpg

# Check server health
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

## Rate Limiting

The caching mechanism helps prevent hitting Unsplash API rate limits by serving cached photos when available. The minimum cache duration of 600 seconds ensures responsible API usage.
